## How to do staking in Polkadot?

Polkadot recommends to use the polkadot.js browser extension to create staking adresses.
Staking is supported bij Ledger Nano X/S, so there will also be a guide for that.

Step 1. Installing Polkadot.js browser extension

https://polkadot.js.org/extension/ (Download it for Chrome or Firefox)

You will now see the orange Polkadot logo top right. Click on it and proceed

Step 2. Creating a new account



### Ivan's proposal for the layout of the document

Lets leave this at the bottom for reference:

- List of prerequisites
- Mention that you need at least certain amount of $DOT and how to check that on substrate (this is
  in development at WEB3 to be added, now there is no way to check min. stake)
- Creating stash and controller account
- Bonding
- Warning about bonding 28 days lockdown
- Nominating
- What to look in a validator? How to research validators? Oversubscribed validators? Limit on
  nominator number per validator that can receive payouts.
- Payouts
